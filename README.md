# Expected Value
This program was made in order to help solve problem 8.4 from book *Programming Pearls* using STL and multithreading
## What is does?
It generates random vector of numbers from interval [-1, 1) and finds subvector which sum is the biggest in all the other subsvectors.
## How to use it?
In order to compile it use:
```
make
```
To count expected value of vector length *n* with given *sample*:
```
./expected_value n sample
```
where *n* and *sample* are positive integers
